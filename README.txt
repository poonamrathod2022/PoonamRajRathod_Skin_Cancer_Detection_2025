# Project Name : Skin Cancer Detection using CNN
> Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- This project talks about, Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.    It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.

- Building a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

- The data is used from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xLfSQUGDl8ezNNbUkpuHOYvSpTyxVhCs/view

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
1. We can clearly observe a drastic difference between Traning(0.87) and Validation Accuracy(0.53), which indicates that the model has overfitted
2. Also we can observe that the validation accuracy the model has achieved is below 55 %
3. Overall we need to apply techniques like Data Augmentation to handle the overfitting issue of the model

- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
- As we can see that now the Training and Validation accuracy are almost in the same level and the highest accuracy achieved is around 60% , this shows the impact of how performing Data Augmentation can improve the model performance.

- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
